# svypd-stata-public
Stata program to estimate survey proportions

This program estimates survey proportions in Stata.  It does not return results to the log window, but provides some stored scalars and matrices for programmers to access.  To view the estimation results, type the command `return list` after running svypd.

The program addresses some current shortcomings of Stata's `svy: proportion` command.  Those shortcomings and how they are addressed are described in the .do file named "Demonstrate advantages of user-written svypd program.do".
